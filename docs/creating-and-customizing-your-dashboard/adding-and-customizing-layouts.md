Widgets can be added into layouts that display multiple widgets compacted into one card.

## Adding a Layout

To add a layout, first click the "Add Widget" button on the top of the screen. Then, click the tab that says "Layouts".

To drag a layout onto the screen, click the tile for the layout you want to add, and drag it onto the screen.

Just like with regular widgets, a layout can be resized by clicking and dragging the edges of the box.

## Adding Widgets to Layouts

To add a widget to a layout, simply drag an existing widget over the layout, and when your mouse cursor is hovering over the layout, it will be highlighted yellow. Letting go of your mouse cursor will place the widget into the layout.

Alternatively, you can drag a widget from the "Add Widget" dialog straight into the layout.

## Moving Widgets Back onto Grid

If you want to remove a widget from a layout and add it back to the grid, simply click and drag the widget out of the layout and back to where you want it on the grid.

## Deleting Widgets From Layout

If you have a widget in a layout that you want to remove entirely, right click on the layout, then click "Edit Properties".

When you click edit properties, a menu will show up with settings to edit and reorder each element in the layout.

Clicking the trash can button next to the widget will remove that widget from the layout.

## Editing the Order and Properties of Widgets in a Layout

To change the order or properties of a widget in your layout, right click the layout, then click "Edit Properties", which will bring up a menu that looks like this.

To move a widget to a different spot in the layout, click and drag the handle on the right.

To change the properties of a widget that is in your layout, click the arrow on the left side of the tile for the widget. Doing so will reveal the editable properties of that specific widget.
