[![Elastic](https://github.com/Gold872/elastic-dashboard/actions/workflows/elastic-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Gold872/elastic-dashboard/actions/workflows/elastic-ci.yml)

A simple and modern dashboard for FRC.

Download files can be found [here](https://github.com/Gold872/elastic-dashboard/releases/latest), the supported platforms are Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

_Important Notes/Warnings:_ 
* _Your robot code must be using WPILib version 2023.3.1 or higher, otherwise you might not be able to add widgets._
    * _WPILib v2023.3.1 fixed a bug in Network Tables where values wouldn't be sent to a client after subscribing topics only. Since the program subscribes topics only to everything, any widget that is built using a sendable will not be possible to add since the program will not be able to retrieve the widget's type. See https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/pull/4991 for more info._
