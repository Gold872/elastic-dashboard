## About

Elastic is a simple and modern FRC dashboard made by Nadav from FRC Team 353. It is meant to be used behind the glass as a competition driver dashboard, but it can also be used for testing. Some unique features include:
* Customizable color scheme with over 20 variants
* Subscription sharing to reduce bandwidth consumption
* Optimized camera streams which automatically deactivate when not in use
* Automatic height resizing to the FRC Driver Station
